# Chat a lot knows nothing

## Problem Statement
As a software engineer, I spend endless hours reading UCS documentation, but I often forget the basics of key financial terms because the volume of material is overwhelming. There are countless documents to sift through, yet all I really want is to ask a domain expert (SME) simple, direct questions like:
“What exactly is a provable debt?”
Instead of spending valuable time digging through dense documentation, I'd rather get a quick, reliable answer and refocus on the engineering work that actually moves the needle.

## My Solution
A chatbot that lets me upload documents for the model to understand and prioritise knowledge directly from them, 
raises no privacy concerns, and answers simple questions like “What is provable debt?” in just seconds.
